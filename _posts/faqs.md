## General Questions

### What is Random (VRD)?

Random (VRD) is a Rust library for generating high-quality random numbers based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm. It provides a robust and efficient implementation of the algorithm, allowing developers to generate random numbers for various purposes, such as simulations, games, and statistical analysis.

### What does VRD stand for?

VRD stands for "**Varied Random Distribution**". The name reflects the library's ability to generate random numbers with a varied and well-distributed output.

### What are the key features of Random (VRD)?

Some of the key features of Random (VRD) include:

- High-quality random number generation based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm
- Efficient and fast generation of random numbers
- Support for various data types, including integers, floats, booleans, and more
- Customizable random number generation with advanced configuration options
- Ability to seed the random number generator for reproducible results
- Easy-to-use API with intuitive methods for generating random numbers

### Who developed Random (VRD)?

Random (VRD) was developed by Sébastien Rousseau, a passionate Rust developer with a strong interest in statistical computing and random number generation.

### Is Random (VRD) open-source?

Yes, Random (VRD) is an open-source library. It is released under a dual license: the MIT license and the Apache License 2.0. This means that you can use, modify, and distribute the library freely, subject to the terms of either license.

## Usage and API

### How do I add Random (VRD) to my Rust project?

To use Random (VRD) in your Rust project, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file under the `[dependencies]` section:

```toml
[dependencies]
vrd = "0.0.6"
```

Then, run `cargo build` to download and compile the library.

### How do I create a new random number generator?

To create a new random number generator, you can use the `Random::new()` method:

```rust
use vrd::random::Random;

let mut rng = Random::new();
```

This will create a new instance of the random number generator with a default seed value.

### How do I generate random numbers of different types?

Random (VRD) provides methods for generating random numbers of various types. Here are a few examples:

```rust
use vrd::random::Random;

let mut rng = Random::new();

let random_u32 = rng.rand();            // Generate a random u32
let random_bool = rng.bool(0.5);        // Generate a random boolean with 50% probability
let random_float = rng.float();         // Generate a random float between 0.0 and 1.0
let random_integer = rng.int(1, 100);   // Generate a random integer between 1 and 100
```

For more details on the available methods, refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/vrd).

### Can I seed the random number generator for reproducible results?

Yes, you can seed the random number generator using the `Random::seed()` method:

```rust
use vrd::random::Random;

let mut rng = Random::new();
rng.seed(12345);
```

By providing the same seed value, you can ensure that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers across multiple runs.

### How can I customize the random number generation?

Random (VRD) provides the `MersenneTwisterConfig` struct that allows you to customize various parameters of the Mersenne Twister algorithm. You can create a custom configuration and pass it to the random number generator:

```rust
use vrd::mersenne_twister::MersenneTwisterConfig;
use vrd::random::Random;

let config = MersenneTwisterConfig::new_custom(
    624,        // n
    397,        // m
    0x9908b0df, // matrix_a
    0x80000000, // upper_mask
    0x7fffffff, // lower_mask
    0x9d2c5680, // tempering_mask_b
    0xefc60000  // tempering_mask_c
);

let mut rng = Random::new_with_config(config);
```

For more information on the available configuration options, refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/vrd).
